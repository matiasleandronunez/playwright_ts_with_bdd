# A Test Automation Framework using Playwright with Typescript bindings

This project is based on my other [repo](https://github.com/matiasleandronunez/typescript_automation_suite) showcases another approach, leveraging mainly Playwright with typescript. 
The [demonstration site](https://practicesoftwaretesting.com) is a live web for the sake of simplicity and resource saving, but can be [hosted or deployed](https://github.com/testsmith-io/practice-software-testing) if you don't want to deal with environment uncertainty

The TAF uses Playwright with TS bindings, POM and Cucumber BBD (but keeps the Playwright runner) and tests in different browsers while dealing with responsiveness of the design.
